    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the vast expanse of the universe, there exists a universe of potential for education, innovation, and unity.
        SpArks is born out of an ambitious dream to explore these possibilities - particularly to extend the benefits and
        wonders of Space science and exploration to as many people as we can across the globe. We believe in a

        is everyone’s adventure.
        Despite tremendous progress and grand feats in the Space sector, an undeniable gap exists. Space, regarded
        as the final frontier, remains largely elusive to the public at large. Space education remains inaccessible for
        many, and public participation is often limited to watching televised launches and landings. Additionally, the
        complex and alluring world of Space exploration has stayed primarily in the playground of a select few
        government entities and private corporations. This exclusivity unknowingly alienates many potential Space
        enthusiasts, hindering the growth of a truly global, inclusive Space community.
        Considering these challenges, we introduce our unique solution - a pioneering, Space-themed digital platform
        designed to democratize Space exploration. This innovative platform is driven by social edutainment,
        seamlessly bridging the gap between the mystery of the cosmos and global audiences. Our platform

    <section id="problem-statement">
      <h2>3. Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>The vast expanses of the universe offer a multitude of opportunities for exploration and growth but are not
        without challenges. A complex interplay of issues, including the general public's disengagement, limited access
        to diversified skills, scarce funding, and a distinct lack of dedicated training frameworks, marks the present
        landscape in the Space sector. This problem scope paints a detailed picture of the hurdles that impede our
        grasp of ubiquitous and sustainable human presence in the cosmos.
        1. Lack of Public Engagement: Despite Space exploration stirring human curiosity and imagination, it
        remains an exclusive domain largely disconnected from the public sphere. This isolation prevents the
        public from having a sense of ownership or engagement, creating a chasm between Space missions
        and the greater community, thereby dampening potential innovations fueled by public interest and
        involvement.
        2. Disconnection between Space Missions and the General Public: The technicalities tied to Space
        missions have inadvertently widened the gap between such missions and the public. This aura of
        
        complexity triggers intimidation rather than fascination, resulting in a disconnect that reduces broad-
        based understanding and participation.
        
        3. Necessity for Diversified Skill Sets: Historically, the Space sector has privileged a particular set of skills
        and qualifications, establishing entry barriers for those outside these perimeters. The need for
        diversification is thus apparent, with the ambitious vision of Space workmanship requiring an eclectic
        mix of talents and perspectives.
        4. Limited Training Frameworks: The field of Space technology and exploration has much to offer, yet
        the absence of comprehensive training programs curbs enthusiastic entrants. A dedicated system of
        training, regardless of a worker's primary background, can level the playing field, paving the way for a
        diversified and enriched workforce adept at tackling the challenges of Space exploration.
        5. Scarcity of Funding: Perhaps the most hindering challenge is the scarcity of financial resources.
        Despite the potential returns being astronomical, the initial costs associated with developing Space
        missions and technologies are staggeringly high, public funding, despite being generous are not
        enough to the task and private funding, injected by entrepreneurs, aren’t yet at the level required.
        These challenges hamper both the speed and scope of developments needed for a stable presence
        of humans in Space.
        Finally, the world we live in is characterized by intense competition, scarcity of resources, multiplying divisions
        that are leading to disguised and open conflicts. These factors hinder progress and collective efforts in various
        sectors, including space exploration. As we witness global tensions and struggles for dominance, it becomes
        crucial to strive for unity, cooperation, and shared responsibility.
        In the realm of space exploration, these competitive forces can impede innovation, limit collaboration, and
        hinder the advancement of technology. The high costs and limited resources associated with space missions
        often exacerbate divisions, resulting in a fragmented and disjointed approach to exploring the cosmos.
        Examining and resolving these hurdles are essential in steering the future trajectory of Space exploration. The
        way forward necessitates innovative, inclusive, and resource-sensitive strategies that adequately address
        these problems, setting the stage for a future where Space becomes a thriving frontier for all of humanity.</p>

    <section id="tokenomics">
      <h2>7. Tokenomics</h2>
      <p>The SPARK (SPK), the token on top of which the SpArks ecosystem is built, is going to be the biggest crypto
        for Space exploration development, it will grow as the number of participants into the community grows.
        The token serves the purpose to bring humanity beyond, supporting the funding of exciting space missions,
        but it is also the mean to enter the games and the educational content of the platform rewarding in this way all
        the possible customer profiles.
        The SPK is a deflationary utility token that has a fixed supply of 300 million tokens. The initial listing price set
        for the token is 0,1EUR aiming to a Full Diluted Value to 30MEUR.
        The fixed supply is divided into different categories that are depicted below:
         Space, aimed to be sold through public sales to initially finance the 1st space mission, before the token
        is listed publicly.
         Rewards, aimed to reward the community with free tokens or the equivalent in perks and features to
        community participants.
         Team, aimed to reward the people working in the front and back end. The Team allocation is
        subsequently divided into smaller categories (ex. Team 1, Team 2, etc.) where in each a different
        percentage of the total Team tokens’ allocation is given. The categories are based on employment
        timing.
         Ecosystem Development, aimed to be sold through public sales to initially finance marketing and
        operations of SpArks, before the token is listed publicly.
         Seed Round 1, aimed to raise money to finance the creation of a first version of the platform.
         Seed Round 2, aimed to raise money to finance the creation of a complete version of the platform.
         Listing, to fund space missions, marketing and general operations of the company after the public
        sales are concluded. These tokens will be listed on a CEX and/or DEX.
         Airdrops, are tokens that will be gifted to the public as a marketing tool. They are not rewards because
        are not given after the completion of a routine game/course from the platform. They may be gifted
        randomly, during events or thanks to the completion of a requested action (ex. participation to a
        challenge, sending invitations to join the platform, etc.).
         Reserve Fund, aimed partially as a liquidity treasury and partially as an investment treasury. The
        allocated tokes may be used for any necessity as spare. The tokens that are not used will just be kept
        as an investment.</p>
      <section id="space">
        <h3>Space (5%)</h3>
        <p>The Space Seed will be used to fund the development of the 1st initiative that aligns with Sparks primary
            objective: contribute to elevate mankind into the Solar System. Examples of utilizations are depicted in section
            10.
            Our team will be responsible for identifying and cultivating some projects, while players will have the final say
            in which project they choose to support. For additional information, please refer to the following Community
            Space Mission section.
            SPK holders will have the power to decide which Community Space Mission will receive funding from the
            Space treasury with a DAO.
            The selling process (a pre-listing public sale) of SPK from the Space Seed for partner technology provider is
            managed to prevent distortion on the market. The public sale will take place 15 months after the TGE will take
            place, and it will last approximately 9 months. This sale will also offer tokens from the Ecosystem Development
            Seed, therefore, SpArks will allocate revenues generated by the sale proportionally to the 2 wallets: 71.4% will
            be allocated to the Space Seed, and 28.6% will go to the Ecosystem Development Seed.
            The buyers of these tokens will be able to choose a cliff and a vesting period between the various options that
            will be offered at the moment of the purchase (minimum cliff will be 6 months and minimum vesting will be 12
            months). By purchasing SPK tokens during this public sale, instead of purchasing later at the listing, the buyers
            will receive advantageous opportunities, such as buying at a lower price then the listing one, or receiving some
            free tokens depending on the amount purchased or the cliff and vesting period chosen.
            One very important thing to know is that any space mission project takes quite a long time due to the
            specificities of sending robotic items into the far distances with very little, practically none, maintenance.</p>

            months). By purchasing SPK tokens during this public sale, instead of purchasing later at the listing, the buyers
            will receive advantageous opportunities, such as buying at a lower price than the listing one, or receiving some
            free tokens depending on the amount purchased or the cliff and vesting period chosen.</p>

        <h3>Rewards (13%)</h3>
        <p>The aim of the Reward Treasury is to incentivize a diverse range of holders to participate in the community by
            earning SPK rewards. These tokens ensure a flourishing and enduring community treasury that rewards all
            stakeholders of the ecosystem. SPK holders can be players, learners, investors, and all future consumers of
            our future products.
            Technically, the Reward treasury will be implemented through ultra-flexible smart contracts, which can
            incorporate a variety of features that provide access to rewards.
            We envision using this portion of the issuance to reward key behaviors within our ecosystem such as:
             Vesting tokens during longer times (2 and 3 years)
             Participating in casual games
             Participating in trainings or certifying paths
            o Young Women (below 35) participating in STEM training and certifying paths will receive
            higher rewards (2x)
             Engaging in exclusive events
             Staking SPK tokens for passive income
             Utilizing upcoming products that have yet to be announced (beta tester)
            The Reward Treasury allows creating a sustainable business model that benefits all shareholders without
            creating a traditional non-profit organization that relies on subsidies and donations. The reward treasury will
            not be accessible until the release of a first version of the platform (that has to comprehend at least 1 course
            and 1 game) and the vesting will depend on the number of people who will be eligible to earn rewards and the
            amount of rewards they earned.</p>

            The tokens will be sold in a private sale to investors at a price that will slowly increase in time, but that will
            always be lower than the public sale price and listing price. There will be a mandatory minimum amount of
            tokens to buy (1000 SPK).
            This first Seed Round will last 6 months, starting from the TGE. The investors will be able to choose between
            different options of cliffs and vesting periods, but the minimum cliff will be set at 12 months as well as the
            minimum vesting. Investors buying in this round will not only benefit from the special lower price, but free
            tokens and other types of rewards (ex. free or early access to new contents) may be given depending on the
            amount of tokens purchased (the more, the bigger the reward) and the cliff and vesting period chosen.
            The difference with the Seed Round 2 and the public sale that will comprehend Space Seed and ED Seed is

      <h2>8. The DAO</h2>
      <p>Ia Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) governance model is selected to ensure transparency and
        allow community involvement, thanks to the Smart Contract capabilities. This section refers the main aspects
        of the governance Model
        8.1 Governance – Sparks Council
        The DAO is governed by the Sparks Council. The Sparks Council is the assembly of all the users owning
        Sparks (SPK) tokens. The council is responsible to manage the entire Sparks ecosystem and the sustaining
        rules and regulations inscribed within the smart contracts.
        Smart Contract included in the tokens give special rights to users that are necessary for participating into
        proposal submission and voting campaigns.
        8.2 Decision-making Process
        The DAO implements a clear decision-making process that outlines how proposals are submitted, reviewed,
        and voted upon. Everyone can participate in decisions. The timeline of decision-making process is as follow:
        1. Proposal Submissions
        Proposals can be submitted by anyone with a sufficient number of SPARKS. Proposals are collected thanks
        to a dedicated form available in the project website. This allows to collect the proposals in the appropriate
        format, well-documented and including all the relevant information about the project, its objectives, funding
        requirements, and expected outcomes. Proposals can be submitted anytime outside voting time, during
        cool-off period and voting times the call forms are closed. For the proposal formats refer to section 10.4
        There are three types of Proposals:
         Change Proposals (CP)
         Improvement & Innovation Proposals (IIP)
         Space Mission Proposals (SMP)
        To submit one CP or IIP proposal, the proposing wallet has to stake a predefined amount of SPK tokens in
        the treasury wallet, the tokens are trasferred to the Space System and Treasury wallet in case the proposal
        is rejected for IIP and CP.
        To make the submission of SMP proposal an entertaining experience, no tokens will be staked, but to avoid
        overwelming participation, only 1 SMP proposal can be proposed by any wallet at any term.4. Voting Period and mechanics
        For changing rules and regulations behind the DAO and the structure of the project, a voting period of 2
        
        weeks is open every 6 months to vote the various proposals accumulated in the period in an accepted-
        rejected format. Proposals rejected cannot be resubmitted.
        
        For the Community Missions, the DAO the voting period is the same, but for the mechanics refer to section
        11.
        INSERT DIAGRAM OF THE VOTING PERIODS
        5. Public Result Announcement
        The results are announced to the public within a dedicated page within the Sparks Discord channel and in
        the website
        6. Implementation process
        The implementation of the proposals accepted is governed by the operations of the company and is tracked
        by the DAO following the scheme included within the proposal.
        8.3 Voting Mechanism:
        Voting is limited to the holders of voting tokens that ensure voting rights. These voting tokens are special NFTs
        created as reward in participating to the community, submitting proposals, staking tokens, participating in
        games and educations from the reward pool. The votes will be executed with quadratic voting. To submit a
        number of votes higher than 1 on a specific proposal is allowed but the cost of NFTs for hte voting wallet
        follows a power of 2 law. The NFTs spent to vote will return to the Reward pool.
        8.4 Proposal Documentation
        Two Call for Proposals forms are available on the project website to one dedicated to the Community Missions
        and another for changes in the DAO and the project structure. Every proposal requires to stake some token to
        avoid
        The proposal for Community Missions is the mechanisms for which anyone in the community can propose
        mission of specific interest. It requires to provide:
        Scope of the Mission
        8.5 Voting Token Role
        Voting tokens are allocated out of the reward pool.
        These special NFTs are given following the rules reported in the following table</p>

    <section id="community-space-mission">
      <h2>9. Community Space Mission</h2>
      <p>Community Space missions are missions decided and voted by the community. SPK tokens acquire voting
        capabilities to people participating to quests (winners) and events in the community, excelling in training (tests
        passed with score above 95%) and in the games (top 5%) or paying for high tiers memberships.
        Community Space missions differentiate from missions required for the community operations, as they are the
        main objective of the entire ecosystem: bring humans beyond. Examples of potential space missions are
        plentiful, where the only limit is the creativity, if we neglect the financial aspects: a mission to observe the
        oceans, the glaciers or migration of peoples or animals, a mission to observe lava tubes on the Moon or search
        for valuable resources below the regolyth layer, A probe to Titan to surf the methane waves or to Europa or Io
        to drill the frozen layer separating from the liquid ocean beneath.
        Anyone in the community can provide ideas for Community Space Missions as from Token Generation Event.
        Ideas will be logged into a special form and evaluated by the DAO for their potential scientific or edutainment
        interest and completeness. The DAO will be responsible for opening and closing the call for ideas depending
        on the buffer level.
        The ideas filtered by the DAO are submitted to the anchor technology provider, that will classify them for costs
        and technical feasibility. The DAO will then place them in a set (9) of missions of special interest and that fit in
        three different classes Small, Medium and Large, while the remaining will remain in the buffer of potential
        missions. We expect 3 missions in each class.
         Small Missions are missions that can be developed, launched and set in operations within 3 years,
        the amount required does not exceed 50MEUR and they remain within the Earth-Moon system.
         Medium Missions are missions that can be developed, launched and set in operations within 5 years,
        the amount required does not exceed 100MEUR.
         Large Missions are missions that can be developed and launched within 5 years, the amount required
        does not exceed 300MEUR.We expect to have the 9 ideas filtered by Token Generation Event (TGE) + 12 months when there will be the
        first vote by the community (limited to holder of special voting rights) that will decide the first mission. DAO will
        be responsible for ensuring the activation of the correct mission class depending on the status of the value of
        the SPARK and the treasury available.
        We expect recurrent votes on different mission classes with the time, depending on the growth of the
        community and the value of the SPARK, decided by the DAO, but with a minimum time between votes of 12
        months. The DAO will be responsible for the opening and closing of voting and the follow-up of the
        development.
        The mission will be followed thoroughly through daily streaming, recurrent webcast and special events that will
        show the progress of the mission, but also contribute to the scope of educating people to Space technologies
        and in general to STEM disciplines.</p>

        extraordinary expedition as we embark on a journey to make the magic of Space exploration accessible to all.
